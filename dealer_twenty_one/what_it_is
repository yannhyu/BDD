This tutorial will walk you through writing tests for and coding a feature of a Twenty-One (or "Blackjack") game. Specifically, we'll be testing the logic for the dealer. To get started, create a root directory where your code will go, and then create the following directories and blank files:

.
├── features
│   ├── dealer.feature
│   └── steps
│       └── steps.py
└── twentyone.py

Here's a brief explanation of the files:

    dealer.feature: The written out tests for the dealer feature.
    steps.py: The code that runs the tests in dealer.feature.
    twentyone.py: The implementation code for the dealer feature.
