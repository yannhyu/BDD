Writing Your First Test

we'll start with the tests.

Writing the Scenario

Open dealer.feature and add the following first line:

Feature: The dealer for the game of 21

This line describes the feature. In a large application, you would have many features. Next, we'll add a test. The first test will be simple â€” when the round starts, the dealer should deal itself two cards. The word Behave uses to define a test is "Scenario", so go ahead and add the following line:

Scenario: Deal initial cards

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

to understand the three phases of a basic Behave test: "Given", "When", and "Then". "Given" initializes a state, "When" describes an action, and "Then" states the expected outcome. For this test, our state is a new dealer object, the action is the round starting, and the expected outcome is that the dealer has two cards. Here's how this is translated into a Behave test:

Scenario: Deal initial cards
  Given a dealer
  When the round starts
  Then the dealer gives itself two cards
